# snake-game-with-turtle
This code implements a classic Snake Game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that players control to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score while navigating within the game boundaries.

Key Components
Import Statements: 

The code imports necessary classes and functions from the turtle module, along with custom classes for the Snake, Food, and Scoreboard, as well as the time module for controlling the game speed.
Screen Setup:

A screen is created with a width and height of 600 pixels, a black background, and an appropriate title ("My Snake Game"). The tracer(0) method is called to disable automatic screen updates, allowing for manual control over when the screen is refreshed.
Game Objects:

Instances of the Snake, Food, and Scoreboard classes are created. These instances handle the snake's movements, food appearance and refresh logic, and scoring respectively.
User Input:

The game listens for keyboard input, using the onkey method to bind the arrow keys to corresponding movement functions (up, down, left, right) of the snake.
Game Loop:

The game() function serves as the main game loop, which runs continuously while the game is active:
The screen updates for each iteration, with a sleep delay (0.1 seconds) to control the game's speed.
The snake moves forward with each iteration.
Collision detection is implemented for:
Food: If the snake's head is close enough to the food (less than 15 pixels), the food is refreshed at a new location, the snake grows by one segment, and the score is increased.
Walls: If the snake's head collides with any edge of the screen (outside the boundaries), the game ends, and a game-over message is displayed.
Tail: If the snake's head collides with any of its segments (excluding its own head), the game also ends, implementing an additional end condition.
Game Termination:

After the game ends, the screen.exitonclick() method is called to keep the window open until the player clicks on it, allowing them to view their score before closing.
Main Functionality:

The program starts execution in the main() function, which encapsulates the screen setup, game object creation, user input configuration, and the initiation of the game loop. This structure promotes organized code and improves readability.
